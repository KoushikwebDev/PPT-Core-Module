## 1. Explain all the CSS positions(static, fixed, sticky, relative, absolute) with one code example each.

`Static: Elements with static positioning are positioned according to the normal document flow. They are not affected by any positioning properties and remain in their default position.

Fixed: Elements with fixed positioning are positioned relative to the viewport. They stay fixed in their position even when the page is scrolled.

Sticky: Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. Elements are initially positioned according to the normal flow but become fixed once a specified threshold is reached, typically when scrolling.

Relative: Elements with relative positioning are positioned relative to their default position in the document flow. They can be moved using the top, right, bottom, or left properties.

Absolute: Elements with absolute positioning are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor or the document itself if no ancestor is positioned. They are taken out of the normal document flow and do not affect the positioning of other elements.`

## 2. Explain what is execution context in detail with diagram.

`Execution is the process of running a program's code to carry out its instructions. It involves steps such as compilation/interpretation, memory allocation, fetching instructions, decoding them, fetching operands, executing the instructions, storing results, and repeating the process until the program ends. During execution, the code is translated into actions, data is manipulated, and control flow is determined, ultimately resulting in the desired outcome of the program.`
